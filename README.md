# ***Golden Book***

#### Important / Warning

There are some stuff that it's hidden when using this theme. One of them it's the *left side dock ribbon*. If you don't have a shortcut to open it, you need to set one. 

You can use the shortcut `Ctrl + ,` (Windows) / `Cmd + ,` (Mac) in order to access the Settings Menu. Once you are there, you can go to the shortcuts panel and set one for both sides.

If you don't want that side to be hidden, don't worry, you can change it with the Style Settings plugin.

## Plugins

> **Note** - There is no need of ***ANY*** plugin for you to use Obsidian, this is just a list of Plugins that I find useful and that are affected by this theme

- **Necessary Plugins** - Plugins that are too useful to not be used
	- *Advance Table*
	- *Editor Syntax Highlight* - PLEASE, use it. It's for your own sake, trust me on this one
	- *Language Tool Integration* - ONLY if your main language isn't English
	- *Style Settings* - Without it, you won't be able to change any `.css` setting that this theme provide
		- Actually, this is needed, in order to make the `.css` work correctly
	- *Folder Note*
- **Recommended Plugins** - Plugins that will help you a lot if you know what you are doing with your Vault and like to automate things
	- *Templater*
	- *Dataview* - Little programming experience recommended (If you don't have it, just learn it either on their [Documentation Page](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) or in the Obsidian Discord Channel. (It's not *that* difficult to use))
	- *Calendar*
	- *Kanban* 
- **Interesting Plugins** - Plugins that are useful in the right hands
	- *Admonition*
	- *Table Extended*
	- *Sliding Panes*
	- *Quick Explorer*
	- *File Tree Alternative*
