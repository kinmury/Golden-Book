<h1 align="center"><b><i> Golden Book </i></b></h1>

<p align="center">Welcome to Golden Book<br><br> As of today, 2021/11/07, I just made the Rework of the theme. The main reason behind the rework is the fact that I have gain a little more experience of CSS, and know how to make the previews thinks look better. And there was some issues that needed fixing by redoing almost most of the theme.<br><br> Be aware that the changes may be very big between the previews Golden Book, and the actual _Golden Book_. So, if you liked the preview version more than the actual, **fear not**, because the preview version is saved and you can download it from the releases.<br><br><b><i>Hope you like and enjoy the Rework :D</b></i></p>

<h2 align=center> Aside Notes </h2>

I removed the `Aside Notes` from the theme. Since it's something that can be used in any other theme, I just made a snippet out of it. 

If you want to use that functionality, you just need to download the snippet, and put it in your Snippet Folder of your Vault

<h2 align=center> Instalation </h2>

## Instalation - Obsidian

*Community Tab* - Go on `Settings>Appearance>"Open Community Themes"` and Search for "Golden Book". Once finded, just apply it and *enjoy it :D*.

## Instalation - GitHub

1. **Download the file "obsidian.css** - You can "clone" this repo using git, or you can just simply press the green button "Code", and then "Download ZIP".
2. **Move the theme to the folder "(YourVaultName)/.obsidian/theme"** - When you have the theme downloaded, you need to copy it on the "theme folder", for it to appear on your Obsidian Vault.
   - _Recomendation_ - Since you downloaded it from GitHub, the name of the theme would be "obsidian" instead of "Golden Book". Feel free to change the "obsidian.css" file name to "GoldenBook.css" so you can find it easier on the Theme Manager
4. **Choose the theme on Obsidian Settings** - Once your done with the previous steps, you just need to choose the theme "GoldenBook" on your Obsidian Setting.
