#### \> Important / Warning

There are some stuff that it's hidden when using this theme. One of them it's the *left side dock ribbon*. If you don't have a shortcut to open it, you need to set one. 

You can use the shortcut `Ctrl + ,` (Windows) / `Cmd + ,` (Mac) in order to access the Settings Menu. Once you are there, you can go to the shortcuts panel and set one for both sides.

If you don't want that side to be hidden, don't worry, you can change it with the Style Settings plugin.

<h2 align=center> Instalation </h2>

## Instalation - Obsidian

*Community Tab* - Go on `Settings>Appearance>"Open Community Themes"` and Search for "Golden Book". Once finded, just apply it and *enjoy it :D*.

## Instalation - GitHub

1. **Download the file "obsidian.css** - You can "clone" this repo using git, or you can just simply press the green button "Code", and then "Download ZIP".
2. **Move the theme to the folder "(YourVaultName)/.obsidian/theme"** - When you have the theme downloaded, you need to copy it on the "theme folder", for it to appear on your Obsidian Vault.
   - _Recomendation_ - Since you downloaded it from GitHub, the name of the theme would be "obsidian" instead of "Golden Book". Feel free to change the "obsidian.css" file name to "GoldenBook.css" so you can find it easier on the Theme Manager
4. **Choose the theme on Obsidian Settings** - Once your done with the previous steps, you just need to choose the theme "GoldenBook" on your Obsidian Setting.
