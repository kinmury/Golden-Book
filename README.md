#### Important / Warning

There are some stuff that it's hidden when using this theme. One of them it's the *left side dock ribbon*. If you don't have a shortcut to open it, you need to set one. 

You can use the shortcut `Ctrl + ,` (Windows) / `Cmd + ,` (Mac) in order to access the Settings Menu. Once you are there, you can go to the shortcuts panel and set one for both sides.

If you don't want that side to be hidden, don't worry, you can change it with the Style Settings plugin.

## Aside / Hidden Text

There is a new way to use `<aside>`. Let's say that you have this on your note: 

```md
<aside>A really interesting text - ◑.◑</aside>

Information below the hidden message
```

When you see the note in Preview View, you will see this icon:

![[AsidePreviewViewNotHover.png]]

When you hover over that Icon, it will spawn this message:

![[AsidePreviewViewHover.png]]

This icons appears on the left side of the note, and it won't show on your PDFs.

## Plugins

- **Necessary Plugins** - Plugins that are too useful to not be used
	- *Advance Table*
	- *Editor Syntax Highlight* - PLEASE, use it. It's for your own sake, trust me on this one
	- *Language Tool Integration* - ONLY if your main language isn't English

- **Recommended Plugins** - Plugins that will help you a lot if you know what you are doing with your Vault and like to automate things
	- *Templater*
	- *Dataview* - Little programming experience recommended (If you don't have it, just learn it either on their [Documentation Page](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) or in the Obsidian Discord Channel. (It's not *that* difficult to use))
	- *Calendar*
	- *Kanban*
